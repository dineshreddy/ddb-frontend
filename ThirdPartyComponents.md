Concept for the Integration of Third Party Components in the DDB-Frontend
================

#This article describes how to integrate third-paty-components into the DDB-Frontend.

A third-party-component might require its own javascript-files, css-files and server-actions to get the data for display.
It might want to use the whole page for display (still embedded between header and footer of the DDB-Frontend Main-Page) or it is embedded within an existing page.
Nevertheless it will have its own div, so its own template., whic again is wrapped eithe rdirectly into the main template or into an existing one.

#Prerequisites
use grails for implementation (template, endpoints, classes)

#Own page for third-party-component

## Template and endpoint is needed.
